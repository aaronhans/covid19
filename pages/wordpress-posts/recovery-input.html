<p>California built a roadmap for modifying the statewide stay home order that also maintained community health and resiliency. We asked Californians to give input on the best way to reopen different sectors of our economy through the California Recovery Roadmap Survey.</p>



<p>The state received innovative proposals from California businesses and labor representatives on how they adapted their workplaces to reduce the risk of coronavirus transmission. </p>



<p>We also heard from you–business owners, workers, customers–about physical and environmental adaptations that could make workplaces safer and protect our communities.</p>



<p>Thank you for shaping a more resilient future for California.</p>
