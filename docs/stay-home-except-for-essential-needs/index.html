<p>On August 28, 2020, the State released the <a href="https://covid19.ca.gov/safer-economy/" title="visit Blueprint for a Safer Economy page">Blueprint for a Safer Economy</a> to permit gradual reopening of certain businesses and activities. Counties are assigned tiers that are updated weekly and determined by the county’s case rate and test positivity rate. Local jurisdictions may have more restrictive local orders than the assigned tier.</p>



<h2 id="hospital-surge">Hospital Surge Order</h2>



<p>Counties with 10% ICU availability or less, in regions with 0% ICU availability, are directed to prioritize services to those who are sickest and cancel or reschedule elective surgeries. This is per the <a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/Amendment-to-the-Order-of-the-State-Public-Health-Officer-Hospital-Surge-1-15-2020.aspx">Hospital Surge Public Health Order</a>, updated January 15, 2021.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.gov.ca.gov/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/12.3.20-Stay-at-Home-Order-ICU-Scenario.pdf">Regional Stay Home Order (PDF)</a>, announced December 3, 2020, triggered additional restrictions after a region was announced to have less than 15% ICU availability. It prohibited private gatherings of any size, closed sector operations except for critical infrastructure and retail, and required 100% masking (with certain exceptions as indicated in <a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/guidance-for-face-coverings.aspx">guidance for use of face coverings</a>) and physical distancing.<br><br>The Regional Stay Home Order was lifted January 25, 2021 as projected ICU availability over 4 weeks in all regions rose to over 15%.

            <h4>Why was the Regional Stay Home Order put into place?</h4>
                  </div><div class="plus-munus"></div>

                  <div class="card-body">
            <p>The Regional Stay Home Order was put into place to address a crisis in ICU capacity that was caused by unprecedented exponential community transmission combined with scarce hospital resources in equipment, space, and staffing. Regions entered the Regional Stay Home Order when the regional ICU capacity fell below 15%. Four out of five of California’s regions were at some time subject to the Regional Stay Home Order. The State’s overall ICU capacity fell to 0% in December, pointing to the statewide nature of the crisis. The Regional Stay Home Order was necessary to avoid a collapse of hospital capacity and the need to transition to crisis standards of care, which could result in rationing of access to ventilators and other lifesaving treatment and&nbsp; scores of unnecessary deaths.</p>
<p>Regions exited the Regional Stay Home Order when their projected four-week ICU capacity rose above 15%. ICU capacity is projected four weeks out because ICU capacity is a lagging indicator; even if ICU capacity is below 15% today, those hospitalizations are results of infections that were weeks ago, not because of current transmission rates. Projected ICU capacity is based on four factors: current estimated regional ICU capacity available, measure of current community transmission, current regional case rates, and the proportion of cases being admitted to the ICU.</p>

            <h4>Is the Regional Stay at Home Order still in effect?</h4>

            <p>No. All four Regions that were subject to the Regional Stay Home Order have exited because their projected four-week ICU capacity is above 15%. The Sacramento Region exited on January 12 with a projected four-week ICU capacity of 19.1%. The Bay Area Region exited on January 25 with a projected four-week ICU capacity of 25.0%. The Southern California Region exited on January 25 with a projected four-week ICU capacity of 33.3%.The San Joaquin Valley Region exited on January 25 with a projected four-week ICU capacity of 22.3%. The Northern California Region never fell below 15% in ICU capacity and was at 47.9% on January 25.</p>
<p>These metrics, along with declining cases, hospitalizations, test positivity and transmission rates across the State, demonstrate that the Regional Stay Home Order had its intended effect of interrupting the exponential rate of community transmission that threatened to overwhelm our healthcare delivery system. While COVID-19 remains prevalent and dangerous, with cases still well above our summer surge, the crisis experienced at the end of 2020 has subsided and the additional restrictions imposed beyond those applicable under the Blueprint for a Safer Economy can be rescinded.</p>

For example, you may leave your home to work at any business or other entity that is allowed to open, to engage in in-person worship and protest activities consistent with public health directives, to patronize local businesses, or to care for friends or family members who require assistance (as set forth under <a href="https://covid19.ca.gov/healthcare/#top">Health care</a>).

            <p>There are many ways for you to express your political views without holding a physical, in-person gathering.&nbsp; For example, you may continue to call or write elected officials, write letters to the editor of news publications, display lawn or window signs, or use online and other electronic media (including Zoom rooms, Twitter feeds, Facebook pages, and other digital forums) to express your views.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Additionally, as noted above, you may leave your home for any reason as long as you comply with any other applicable public health directives. When you are otherwise out in public, public health directives do not prevent you from engaging in political expression—such as by wearing or carrying a sign.</p>
<p>If collective action in physical space is important to you, consider whether you and other participants can safely protest from within your cars.&nbsp;The State Public Health Officer does not consider in-car activities to be gatherings, if participants stay in their cars and otherwise remain apart from individuals who are not part of their households.&nbsp;Many activists have organized car-based protests (honking horns, flying flags, displaying signs, and so on) to express their political views while complying with State public health directives.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Whenever you are considering a protest (including an in-car protest), make sure you comply with all other applicable laws, including any local public-health measures that may be more restrictive than statewide directives and any other applicable local laws.</p>
<p>If you do wish to engage in in-person protest outside of your car with a group of any size, you must follow the guidelines for political protest gatherings below.</p>

            <p>Yes, although in-person protests and rallies present special public health concerns&nbsp;for high risk of COVID-19 transmission.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Even with adherence to physical distancing, bringing members of different households together to engage in in-person protests and rallies carries an especially high risk of widespread transmission of COVID-19. &nbsp;Such gatherings may result in increased rates of infection, hospitalization, and death, especially among more vulnerable populations. In particular, activities like chanting, shouting, singing, and group recitation negate the risk-reduction achieved through 6 feet of physical distancing. For this reason, people engaging in these activities must wear face coverings at all times. </p>
<p>Therefore, it is strongly recommended that those exercising their right to engage in political expression (including, for example, their right to petition the government) should utilize alternative channels, such as the many online and broadcasting platforms available in the digital age, in place of in-person gatherings.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, state public health directives do not prohibit in-person <em>outdoor</em> protests and rallies as long as you maintain a physical distance of at least 6 feet between persons or groups of persons from different households at all times. In addition, you must wear a face covering or mask. Local Health Officers are advised to consider appropriate limitations on outdoor attendance capacities, factoring their jurisdiction&#8217;s key COVID-19 health indicators. Failure to follow these requirements may result in an order to disperse or other enforcement action.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In counties in the <a href="https://covid19.ca.gov/safer-economy/">Widespread (purple) tier</a>, indoor protests and rallies are not currently permitted. In other counties, state public health directives do not prohibit in-person&nbsp;<em>indoor</em> protests and rallies as long as&nbsp;(1) attendance is limited as required by the <a href="https://covid19.ca.gov/safer-economy">relevant restrictions</a> on places of worship and local health restrictions, (2)&nbsp;physical distancing of at least 6 feet between persons or groups of persons from different households is maintained at all times, and (3) singing and chanting activities are discontinued.&nbsp;Failure to follow these requirements may result in an order to disperse or other enforcement action.&nbsp;Masks and face coverings are required in compliance with CDPH directives.</p>
<p>Participants must maintain a physical distance of at least 6 feet from any uniformed peace officers and other public safety personnel present, unless otherwise directed, and follow all other requirements and directives imposed by local health officers and law enforcement, or other applicable authorities.</p>
<p>This limitation on attendance will be reviewed regularly. This review will assess the impacts of these imposed limits on public health and provide further direction as part of a phased-in restoration of gatherings that implicate the First Amendment.</p>

<p>Although in-person religious gatherings—like other in-person gatherings—have been restricted to prevent the transmission of COVID-19, on May 25, 2020, the State Public Health Officer began to ease restrictions on in-person religious gatherings. In particular, the State Public Health Officer now authorizes County Departments of Public Health to allow collective activities at places of worship, subject to conditions that support a safe, clean environment for employees, interns and trainees, volunteers, scholars, and all other types of workers as well as congregants, worshippers, and visitors.</p>

Additional conditions may be imposed by local public health officials. This guidance does not obligate places of worship to resume in-person activity. It is strongly recommended that places of worship continue to facilitate remote services and other alternatives to in-person religious practice for those who are vulnerable to COVID19.</p>
<p>Even with adherence to physical distancing, convening in a congregational setting of multiple households to practice a personal faith carries a higher risk of widespread transmission of COVID-19, and may result in increased rates of infection, hospitalization, and death, especially among more vulnerable populations. In particular, activities like singing and group recitation dramatically increase the risk of COVID-19 transmission. For this reason, singing and chanting activities must be discontinued at indoor services, and congregants engaging in group recitation should wear face coverings at all times.</p>
<p>Places of worship may only open indoor operations when permitted by <a href="https://covid19.ca.gov/safer-economy">relevant local restrictions</a> and must comply with all applicable attendance limitations and guidance requirements.</p>
<p>Local Health Officers are advised to consider appropriate limitations on&nbsp;<em>outdoor&nbsp;</em>attendance capacities, factoring their jurisdiction&#8217;s key COVID-19 health indicators. At a minimum, outdoor attendance should be limited naturally through implementation of strict physical distancing measures of a minimum of 6 feet between attendees from different households, in addition to other relevant protocols within this document. </p>

<p>During approved performances, all audience members and others not performing must wear masks, and audience members from different households must be spaced at least six feet apart when seated or otherwise viewing the performance. Performers who are not wearing face coverings must be at least six feet apart from each other.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Approval is not required in counties with a “Moderate” or “Minimal” risk level for a live musical, theatrical, or artistic performance if, in aggregate, members of no more than three households attend, perform, or otherwise are involved in the performance.</p>
<p>Additionally, live performances are permitted to the extent that they are permitted by applicable sector guidance for the venue hosting such a performance (such as restaurants, wineries, or bars).</p>
