            <p>Influenza (flu) and COVID-19 are both contagious respiratory illnesses, but they’re caused by different viruses. COVID-19 is caused by a <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/faq.html#Basics">new coronavirus (called SARS-CoV-2)</a> and flu is caused by <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/viruses/index.htm">influenza viruses</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The symptoms of flu and COVID-19 are similar. It is hard to tell the difference between them without testing.</p>
<p>Cases of COVID-19 and flu can have anything from no symptoms (asymptomatic) to severe symptoms. Common symptoms that COVID-19 and flu share include:</p>
<ul><li>Fever or chills</li><li>Cough</li><li>Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing</li><li>Fatigue (tiredness)</li><li>Sore throat</li><li>Runny or stuffy nose</li><li>Muscle pain or body aches</li><li>Headache</li><li>Vomiting and diarrhea (more common in children than adults)</li></ul>
<p>The major difference between them is COVID-19 may include change in or loss of taste or smell.</p>

            <p>Children can be infected with coronavirus and can get sick with COVID-19. Most children with COVID-19 have mild symptoms, or they may have no symptoms at all (“asymptomatic”). Fewer children have been sick with COVID-19 compared to adults. However, children with certain <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-extra-precautions/people-with-medical-conditions.html#children-underlying-conditions">underlying medical conditions</a> and infants (less than 1 year old) might be at increased risk for severe illness from COVID-19. Some children have developed a rare but serious disease that is linked to COVID-19 called <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/daily-life-coping/children/mis-c.html">multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS-C)</a>.</p>

            <p>The disease has not existed long enough for us to really know. But as the pandemic unfolds, we are learning that many organs besides the lungs are affected by COVID-19, and there are many ways it can affect someone’s health.</p>
<p>While most people with COVID-19 recover and return to normal health, some patients can have symptoms that can last for weeks or even months after recovery from acute illness. Even people who are not hospitalized and who have mild illness can experience persistent or late symptoms.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The most commonly reported long-term symptoms include:</p>
<ul><li>Fatigue</li><li>Shortness of breath</li><li>Cough</li><li>Joint pain</li><li>Chest pain</li></ul>
<p>Other reported long-term symptoms include:</p>
<ul><li>Difficulty with thinking and concentration (sometimes referred to as “brain fog”)</li><li>Depression</li><li>Muscle pain</li><li>Headache</li><li>Intermittent fever</li><li>Fast-beating or pounding heart (also known as heart palpitations)</li></ul>
<p>More serious long-term complications appear to be less common but have been reported. These have been noted to affect different organ systems in the body. These include:</p>
<ul><li>Cardiovascular: inflammation of the heart muscle</li><li>Respiratory: lung function abnormalities</li><li>Renal: acute kidney injury</li><li>Dermatologic: rash, hair loss</li><li>Neurological: smell and taste problems, sleep issues, difficulty with concentration, memory problems</li><li>Psychiatric: depression, anxiety, changes in mood</li></ul>
<p>The long-term significance of these effects is not yet known.</p>

            <p>There is no evidence that COVID-19 spreads indoors through air conditioning. There are a wide variety of heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) systems. Well-designed HVAC systems can actually help reduce risk. Since the system filters air as it circulates, it adds cleaner air to the space. Introduction of fresh outdoor air dilutes the concentration of infectious particles. Air conditioning is also necessary in some areas to protect from excessive heat.

<p>Keep in mind that some respiratory symptoms from wildfire smoke exposure and COVID-19 may be similar. These include cough, sore throat, and difficulty breathing.</p>
<p>COVID-19 symptoms that are unrelated to smoke exposure include fever or chills, muscle or body aches, and diarrhea. If you think you may have COVID-19, contact your doctor.</p>
